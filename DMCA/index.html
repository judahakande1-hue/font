        <p>
            Font.Download is in compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). It is our policy to respond to any infringement <br> notices and take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable intellectual property laws. <br>
<br>
All fonts on font.download are uploaded by designers and they certify that they are the legal owner or representative of the font they upload. Unfortunately we do not have the technology and manpower to check the commercial or legal aspect of every font that is uploaded. Still, to make things easier, we developed a tool that allows you to easily send a violation notice by using the "Report a Violation" button in the right corner of the font page. <br><br>
These requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner's behalf. Most of the time, a solution is provided within 1-3 business days. <br>
<br><br>
Make sure that the font you are giving a violation notice of belongs to you. Sometimes there can be more than one font with the same name. This does not mean that you own different fonts with similar or the same name.
<br>
If you are going to report violation for multiple fonts, you must make a separate notification using the "Report a Violation" button on the page of each font.
<br> <br>
The complaining party must prove that they are the owner or legal representative of the font.
<br>
Please be aware that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you misrepresent information listed on our site that is infringing on your copyrights.
